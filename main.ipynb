    "In this notebook, we will analyze the political bias of two word embeddings: ConceptNet Numberbatch and GloVe 840B. This is a relevent topic as tthe popular word embeddings are widely used in large language models and other NLP tasks. As of writing this notebook (February 2023) the use large language models (LLMs) has just reached the mainstream. With the OpenAI's release of ChatGPT and its viral reception, people are using large language models more than ever. Bing has incorporated a version of ChatGPT into their search engine and a race to deploy LLMs at scale as begun, with competitors like Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon all working on their own versions. <br><br>\n",
    "While these LLMs have shown to be impressive tools for tasks from text sumarizations, song writing and even code generation, these models do come with their caveats. As  detailed in the paper [*On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922), large language models are prone to bias which can have significant repercussions in perpetuating these biases depending on their use cases. For example, many are using LLMs in place of search engines to ask factual questions. While there are many issues at play here, one is that political bias can influence the nature of the answer. In a text summarization use case, the model can alter the political leaning of the originial text, or insert one that was not there in the first place. While political beleifs are constantly changing, the embeddings of these models cannot be changed as easily. This means that the bias of these models will be perpetuated for years to come and will no longer represent political leaning as tides shift. Additionally, perpetuating bias at scale leads to more polarity among the populus.<br><br>\n",
    "This investigation is relevant to other researchers and practitioners as it will help them to better understand the political bias of these models. This information can also help them understand which use cases are appropriate for these embeddinigs. Our finidings may also lead researchers and practitioinaers to re-evaluate their existinig models that use these embeddings and consider mitigatiioni techniques,or alternatives. <br>"

    "In invstigating these questions, when we say \"political bias\" we are referring to the political leaning in the context of the United States. We are not referring to the political leaning of the embeddings themselves. For example, we are not saying that the embeddings are \"left-leaning\" or \"right-leaning\" but rather that the embeddings are biased towards a certain political leaning.\n"

    "In order to conduct this investigation, we will train a classifier on news headlines from highly polarized news sources. We will train an identical model on the same data, but one with ConceptNet Numberbatch embeddings and one with GloVe 840B embeddings. We will then use this classifier to assign political leanings to headlines from a new source that is neither left-leaning nor right-leaning. Next, we will pcil 100 headlines that we have decided are apolitcal. Finally, we will prediict the political leanings of these headlines using both models and compare the results. If the embeddings are biased, we would expect the model with the embeddings to be biased as well. <br><br>\n",

We observed which of the news sources with bias scores existed in our [news headlines dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news). From these news sources we decided to use Vox as our left leaning source, Fox News as our right leaning source, and Business Insider as our neutral source. In the paper mentioned above, the authours assigned bias scores on a scale of -1 to 1, with -1 being the most left leaning and 1 being the most right leaning. The scores for the news sources we chose are as follows: \n",
    "- Vox: -0.5546\n",
    "- Fox News: 0.6079\n",
    "- Business Insider: -0.0373.\n",

We also hypothesize that the bias will be more pronounced GloVe 840B embeddings as they are trained on a larger corpus of data, which is based on a large portion of text that exists on the internet. Since ConceptNet is curated by humans with bias mitigation in mind, we believe that it will contain less political bias. <br><br>"

    "\n",
    "In this project we will be comparing two identical models trained on identical data, one with ConcepNet Numberbatch as a word embedding, and the other with GloVe 840b as a word embedding on the other. In order to compare the two models, we will predict the polarity of headlines from a new source that is neither left-leaning nor right-leaning. And we will also predict the polarity of \"expert\" (us) chosen headlines that we deemed to be completely neutral in political polarity.<br><br>\n",
    "The polarity of the models are independant from one another. In our methods, predictions closer to 0.5 are considered neutral. The model tthat deviates most from 0.5 is considered to be the most biased. However we beleive that the meaningful analysis of this study will not come from comparing the two models to each other, but it will come from independantly comparing each model to the 0.5 baseline. Conclusions on whether one embedding is more biased than the other would be secondary to the conclusions on whether the embeddings are independantly biased.<br><br>\n",
    "Some limitaions of our analysis is that it could be argue that are models are simply predicting if Business Insider headlines, are more similar to those of Vox or Fox News. This is why we are hand-picking unbiaed headlines to compare to the models. Aditionally, we are training our models to classify healdines as left leaning or right leaning. Since we do not train on neutral data, accuracy may be lower for headlines that should be classified as neutral. We did not include Business Insider headlines in our trraining data as we did not want to train our models to predict the style of Business Insider headlines.<br><br>"
